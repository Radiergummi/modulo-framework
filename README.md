# modulo-framework
Mini framework for css modules

#### What is Modulo?
Modulo aims to provide a set of modular, simple, semantic and infinitely nestable components for small projects where you don't need the bloat of Bootstrap or similar libraries, but don't want to reinvent the wheel every time either.
Currently, Modulo is entirely CSS but will be extended with plain JS components when I find the time.

See this general, ridiculously nested fiddle to quicky see the abilities of the library:
